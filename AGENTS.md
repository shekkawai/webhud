# WebHUD (WebMCP Challenge entry) — agent notes

Public MIT repo `shekkawai/webhud` (renamed 2026-08-30 from `WebMCPChallenge`; GitHub
redirects the old URL), entered in OpenAI's WebMCP Challenge
(**deadline Sept 4 2026, 04:00 HK**). Live at
`https://webhud.shekkawai.workers.dev` — the old worker `webmcp-challenge` now serves
only a 301 redirect to it, kept so pre-rename links and any configured ChatGPT
connector keep working.

The brand is **WebHUD** ("Smart glasses without the vendor OS — a web page, your agent, any glass.", sharpened 2026-08-30 to name smart glasses in the first three words);
the underlying concept keeps its name **smart-responsive**: responsive design adapted *layout* to screen size;
this adapts *interaction and presentation* to context. The agent says what the data is
and what the user needs to do with it; the page decides how it looks on a desk, across
a room, or in a lens. `SPEC.md` is the standard proposal and is the most quotable
artifact in the repo — keep it and the code in agreement.

## Non-negotiables

- **The agent never picks a component.** It sends `purpose` (one of six) plus items via
  `surface_present`; the page maps purpose + context + item shape to a renderer. Layout
  `hint`s are advisory and may be ignored; `purpose` may not. Unknown purpose degrades to
  `browse` rather than failing. Never add `show_table`/`show_dropdown`-style tools — the
  whole argument dies if the vocabulary becomes one tool per widget.
- **Sensitive actions stay human-confirmed.** Ring Select and local tools may open, close,
  focus, and choose. They may never create a calendar event or send anything. The page
  also must not claim "Event added" before the write is confirmed.
- **`surface_get_view_state` returns IDs, titles, and `hasContent`/`hasImage` flags only** —
  never email bodies, never base64 image data. It is the deixis channel ("this one"), not
  a data exfiltration route.
- **Ring/controller input is opt-in via the Ring Mode toggle; the keyboard D-pad is the
  baseline.** Since the D-pad model (2026-08-30): ←/→ move focus, ↓ drops a visible
  highlight onto the dock, ←/→ then move it, Enter/Select opens the highlighted tab or
  focused card, ↑/Escape return to the stage — all local-only actions. `store.swipe()`
  routes to the dock highlight whenever `dockFocus !== null`, so palm/ring/keys stay one
  verb. Outside Ring Mode, the vertical wheel and PageUp/Down still must do nothing, and
  inside an open reader vertical keys/wheel always scroll it (reading beats navigating) —
  no binding may hijack that. **Ring Mode needs zero setup** (since 2026-08-30, after
  Shek's real scroll ring arrived): the toggle activates `DEFAULT_BINDINGS` (wheel up/down
  = Previous/Next, Enter = Select); "Remap buttons" is the optional learn flow for other
  devices. A real ring press is ONE wheel event with a tiny line-unit delta, so both setup
  capture and Ring Mode act on the first event with a cooldown — the old 120px
  accumulator could never be satisfied by ring hardware and is gone. Mouse clicks are
  deliberately not learnable (a saved `pointer:0` binding hijacked every ordinary click;
  stale ones are purged on load). These rules exist because each was a real bug found in a
  browser pass or on real hardware, not by tests.
- **Camera is opt-in, and the pixels never leave the tab.** The privacy line ("the agent
  coached me and never saw me") is load-bearing for the submission.
- Camera, ring, keyboard, mouse and the agent are **independently stackable channels**,
  never a mode switch the user must choose between.

## Verification that actually catches things

`bun test` (98 tests) covers pose maths from real landmark fixtures, the swipe classifier,
purpose mapping, adapter registration lifecycle, and glasses geometry. It has repeatedly
passed while the app was broken in the browser — **every input, motion, or layout change
needs a live `agent-browser` pass too.**

- `agent-browser screenshot <path>` — the full-page flag is `--full`, **not**
  `--full-page`; passing the wrong one silently creates a file literally named
  `--full-page` in the cwd instead of failing. This has happened three times.
- Everything is drivable without a camera: `?demo=mail|drive|calendar|month|reader|slots|options|chosen|people|done|photo|compare`,
  arrow keys mirror the palm swipe 1:1, and `?glasses=1` forces the lens view.
- Glasses mode is **persisted**, so a URL without `glasses=1` can still open in the lens.
  Press `G` or use the Exit button before capturing a "desktop" screenshot.

## Architecture facts (do not re-derive)

- Static Vite build, no backend. `src/webmcp/adapter.ts` resolves both
  `document.modelContext` and the older `navigator.modelContext`, and registers tools with
  an `AbortSignal` so dynamic re-registration genuinely unregisters. Registering by
  signature and re-registering on state change is what makes `toolchange` fire — that is
  the spec feature the judges built and it is a scored part of the entry.
- `src/motion.ts` owns all motion. Deck focus changes are **CSS role classes**
  (`focus`/`prev`/`next`/`far-left`/`far-right`) transitioning on `.card`, not per-frame JS;
  `trackSwipe` only takes over during a live palm drag and `gesture-tracking` disables the
  transition while it does. View swaps animate through two stacked layers in `replace()`.
- `src/views/glasses.ts` is presentational only and must stay that way. `LENS` at the top
  is the only thing to change if the photo is swapped. The frame — not the photo — is
  anchored to the viewport centre, so a wider window shows more frame, never a cropped one.
  The app gets a real near-square viewport and **reflows**; it is never scaled down.
  On portrait screens `LENS_MAX_W` caps the lens box at the viewport width — the frame
  shrinks and floats centred over the ambient blur instead of the app overflowing the phone.
- **Every glasses entry plays a 3.4 s power-on boot** (dark hold → lens light strip →
  WEBHUD wordmark → scanline → UI materializes), built for filming the video open; **B**
  replays it. It is pure CSS on `body.glasses-booting` (the `boot-*` keyframes); `BOOT_MS`
  in `glasses.ts` must match the keyframe duration, and the `#glasses-boot` overlay is
  pinned to the same lens box as `#app` by `reposition()`. Animating opacity/blur/scale on
  `#app` is safe because all its children are `position: absolute` — never add a
  `position: fixed` child, or the boot (and any future `#app` transform) will re-parent it.
  To freeze a boot phase for a screenshot, pause with a negative `animation-delay`
  override and screenshot within `BOOT_MS`, or the cleanup timer clears the class first.
- **The phone breakpoint reuses the glasses-lens layout.** Under 700px `main.ts` sets
  `body.compact`, and every compact rule is written as `body:is(.glasses-on, .compact)` —
  one layout, two triggers. Phone-only leftovers (chip fit, stacked welcome steps,
  sideways-scrolling week/month, icon-collapsed dock, hidden feed) live in the
  `@media (max-width: 700px)` block at the end of `style.css`, `body.compact`-prefixed so
  they win by source order. Touch swipe (`src/input/touch.ts`) maps a horizontal drag to
  the same one-verb swipe, and ignores drags starting on the map, reader, or calendar
  (panning and scrolling win there).
- `public/mediapipe/` is ~40 MB of vendored WASM + hand-landmarker model (no CDN egress).
  It is deliberate; obligations are recorded in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

## The live map (location shape)

- Items with `lat`/`lng` in `surface_present` render as map pins (`layout: "map"`,
  `renderedAs: map-pins` / `map-lens`). The agent never asks for a map — it sends
  location-shaped data. Tiles are **standard OSM** darkened by a CSS filter on the tile
  pane only; CARTO's dark basemap now watermarks "API KEY REQUIRED", do not go back to it.
  Routing is FOSSGIS OSRM (`routed-foot`), keyless; `walkingRoute()` degrades to a dashed
  straight line on any failure so a demo can never stall on the routing service.
- Leaflet is a **lazy chunk** (`import("./mapview")`) — keep it out of the base bundle.
  The Leaflet instance lives on a persistent module-owned div re-appended each render.
- Two traps, both cost a cycle: **motion finalizes transitions by rewriting
  `stage.innerHTML`**, which silently drops any node appended mid-transition — imperative
  mounts must wait for the `stage-settled` event motion now dispatches after every DOM
  commit. And **`invalidateSize()` cancels an in-flight `flyTo`** — only call it when the
  container size actually changed, and wrap route fits in `safeFlyToBounds` (deferred one
  frame, instant-fit fallback) because flying mid-transition can throw NaN LatLng.
- The user's position is told, not tracked (`map_set_location`); `map_show_route` returns
  only distance/minutes/streets through the tool channel — geometry stays page-side, and
  `getViewState` must never include route points.

## Deploying

`bun run deploy` runs `wrangler deploy` with the Zo secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, which is
a valid account-owned token since 2026-09-19 and the only working credential (the cached
OAuth login is dead). Never prefix `env -u CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; it throws that away.

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs tests + build on every PR and push, then deploys only
if the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repo secret exists. It does not, so CI verifies and **skips
the deploy step cleanly** — that is expected, not a failure. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is
already set. Until Shek creates a Worker-edit token, every deploy is manual from here, so
**always confirm the live bundle hash matches a fresh local build** after pushing.

## Still open

Live connector rehearsal in ChatGPT desktop, and the 3-minute video. Both are the critical
path; new features are not. The video arc is one page shot three ways — desk (keys), across
the room (voice + palm), glasses context (voice + ring) — with no code change between shots.

## Moved from the workspace root notes (2026-09-19)

- Remaining critical path is the ChatGPT connector rehearsal and the video, not features.
- Never prefix `env -u CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (the Zo secret is the working credential since
  2026-09-19; see `Documents/agent-notes/cloudflare-wrangler.md`). CI verifies but skips deploy
  until a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repo secret exists, so confirm the live bundle hash after pushing.
